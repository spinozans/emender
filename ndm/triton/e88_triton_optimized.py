"""Drop-in Triton replacement for E88OptimizedCUDAFunction.

Mirrors the call signature of
``ndm.models.e88_fla_hybrid.E88OptimizedCUDAFunction.apply`` but uses
the Triton forward + backward kernels under the hood. Gate (silu) and L2
normalization are applied as differentiable PyTorch ops outside the
kernel — the recurrence math is unchanged.

Layout: production E88 uses ``[B, T, H, *]``; the Triton kernels use
``[T, B, H, *]``, so we transpose at the boundary.

This wrapper is meant for parity / portability work — it should produce
the same loss as the CUDA path (within numerical tolerance) so you can
swap backends on the fly with ``use_triton=True``.
