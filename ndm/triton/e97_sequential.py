"""E97-named facade for the fused sequential split-edit Triton recurrence.

The proven implementation is shared with the older E88 recurrence engine.
Keeping delegation here avoids duplicating a large forward/backward kernel while
giving E97 a truthful public API and a stable place for future specialization.
